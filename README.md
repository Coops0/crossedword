# Crossedword
A faithful clone of the NYT crossword game in vanilla TypeScript. All functionality with cursor movement is made to be identical.

### future todos
- crossword builder app
  - automatic generation given word list or something (of course crosses need to match!), need to figure out blanks
- save settings (e.x. auto check)
- fix for mobile
- squashed crossword data format
- fix auto scroll (should be smooth), and don't reshow scroll bar if not moving
- alt + down = tab behavior
- alt + up = inverse tab behavior
