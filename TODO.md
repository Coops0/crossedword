# TODO
- crossword builder app
  - automatic generation given word list or something (of course crosses need to match!), need to figure out blanks
- save settings (e.x. auto check)
- fix for mobile
- squashed crossword data format
- fix auto scroll (should be smooth), and don't reshow scroll bar if not moving
	- may be impossible since we re-render on each change. how do frameworks do it?
- alt + down = tab behavior
- alt + up = inverse tab behavior
- visually show the status/block from playing if done
- add current clue at the top of the crossword
- better letter error indicator
- "reveal" and "check" options
